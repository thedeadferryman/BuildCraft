Bug Fixes:

* Fix the heat exchanger passing a null fluid when auto-outputting an empty tank.
* Fix kinesis pipes never configuring on the client, which cause client-side engine rotation to not work correctly.
* [#4385] Fixed the autoworkbench duping leftover tools.

Changes:

* Ported Engine Chaining:
    * Attach up to 3 stirling or 5 combustion engines together in a line to form a chain.
    * "Chained" engines send power directly to their destination.
    * Redstone engines cannot be chained.
* Ported the Gate Copier
    * This doesn't perform any validation on the copied triggers and actions at the moment.
    * It is made in an assembly table from a wrench and an iron chipset.
* Added oil generation debug logging:
    * Enable some logging by adding "-Dbuildcraft.energy.oilgen.debug=log" to your launch arguments.
    * Enable all logging (very spammy) by adding "-Dbuildcraft.energy.oilgen.debug=true" instead of the above to your launch arguments.
* Updated Chinese translation. (SampsonnZ)
* [BuildCraftGuide#2] Added some transport, silicon, triggers, and actions documentation to the guide book (LuigiHutch)
